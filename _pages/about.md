I am a Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/) at [Ben-Gurion University](http://www.bgu.ac.il/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ofer Neiman](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~neimano/) and [Prof. Michael Elkin](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elkinm/).

I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) and Discrete Mathematics.  In particular, I am interested in graph algorithms and combinatorics.

I am currently looking for postdoctoral positions, where I can continue my research.
